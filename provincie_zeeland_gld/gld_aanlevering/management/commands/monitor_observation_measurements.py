# Measurements that are not checked yet, will be checked for quality
# If values are corrected these will be flagged in the observation 
# A new delivery will have to be made to deliver the corrected values
# If values are flagged for deletion, this will also have to flagged in the observation

# Censor values outside measuring range, include parameters for this in 'aanlevering' schema?
